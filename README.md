1. All scripts, text files and data set files are to be kept in the same working directory.

2. Run "statEval_regression.py" to compare Regularized Linear Regression, ANN for Regression and Baseline models using two level Cross-Validation
   It also include the estimation of the optimal lambda and number of hidden units as a complexity controlling parameter.
   It also performs statistical performance evaluation.
   
3. Run "statEval_classification.py" to compare Regularized Multinominal Regression, ANN for MultiClassification and Baseline models using two level Cross-Validation
   It also include the estimation of the optimal lambda and number of hidden units as a complexity controlling parameter.
   It also performs statistical performance evaluation.
   
4. To see the comparation between different feature transformation run: "regChoice.py"

5. To see how the range of lambdas and number of hidden units have been chosen run: "choice_lambdas_hidden_units.py"
